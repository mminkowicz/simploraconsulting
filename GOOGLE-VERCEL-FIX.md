# üîß Google Search Results Fix - Vercel to Simplora

## ‚úÖ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

**Problem:** Google search results were showing "vercel" instead of your website content.

**Root Cause:** The sitemap generation script was using the old Vercel domain (`https://simploraconsulting.vercel.app`) instead of your current domain (`https://www.simplora.co`).

**Fix Applied:** Updated `generate-sitemap.js` and regenerated the sitemap with the correct domain.

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **1. Deploy the Updated Site**
Make sure to deploy your updated website with the corrected sitemap to your hosting platform.

### **2. Google Search Console Actions**
1. **Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)**
2. **Add your property:** `https://www.simplora.co` (if not already added)
3. **Submit updated sitemap:**
   - Go to "Sitemaps" section
   - Submit: `https://www.simplora.co/sitemap.xml`
4. **Request re-indexing:**
   - Go to "URL Inspection"
   - Enter: `https://www.simplora.co`
   - Click "Request Indexing"

### **3. Force Google to Update**
- Search for `site:www.simplora.co` on Google to see current indexed pages
- Use "Fetch as Google" tool in Search Console
- Submit individual important URLs for re-indexing

## ‚è∞ **TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS**

- **Immediate:** Sitemap updated and submitted
- **1-3 days:** Google should start re-crawling your site
- **1-2 weeks:** Search results should begin updating
- **3-4 weeks:** Full re-indexing should be complete

## üîç **MONITORING**

### **Check These URLs Regularly:**
- `site:www.simplora.co` - See what Google has indexed
- `site:simploraconsulting.vercel.app` - Monitor if old URLs are still showing

### **Google Search Console Metrics to Watch:**
- Indexing status
- Crawl errors
- Search performance
- Click-through rates

## üìã **ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **1. Set up 301 Redirects (if applicable)**
If you still have the old Vercel domain active, set up 301 redirects to your new domain.

### **2. Update External Links**
- Check if any external sites are linking to the old Vercel domain
- Contact them to update links to your new domain

### **3. Social Media Updates**
- Update any social media profiles that might reference the old domain
- Share your new website on social platforms

## üéØ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know the fix is working when:
- Google search results show "Simplora" instead of "vercel"
- Your website appears with the correct title and description
- Search Console shows successful indexing
- Organic traffic starts improving

**Note:** Google's re-indexing process can take time. Be patient and continue monitoring your Search Console for updates.
